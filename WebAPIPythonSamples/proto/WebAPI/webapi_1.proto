   // added without removing/ changing any existing messages and fields (new 'proto' file is not created)

}

// Protocol rules:
// 1)  CamelCase with an initial capital is used for message names while fields are lowercase underscore_separated_names
//     (see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style)
// 3)  Key numbers for existing fields must stay the same between minor protocol version changes.
// 4)  Negative values for enums and key numbers are prohibited.
// 5)  Only explicit signed (e.g. sint32) and unsigned (e.g. uint64) integer types must be used. Usage of implicit signed integer
//     types (e.g. int16) is prohibited since they are not supported by JS client library and consume a lot of space for
//     negative values.
// 6)  Unsigned types should be used for fields that cannot have negative values. This allows to minimize their size.
// 7)  Field numbers < 16 takes one byte for a key/ wire-type header so numbers > 16 should be used for optional and infrequently used fields.
//     do not 'reserve' field numbers without real reasons.
//     See https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding for details.
// 8)  Field numbers don't always come in a strict order and so allow to place new fields next to logically related ones.
// 9)  'Result' suffix is used in responses when only a single response is possible.
// 10)  'Status' suffix is used a separate message for a status of a subscription when subscriptions are not optional.
// 11) 'Report' suffix is used in responses when 'Result' and 'Data' are combined in a single message and when subscription is optional,
//     this allows to avoid two messages if subscription is not requested.
// 12) Time attributes that are 64-bit signed integers contain offset in milliseconds from base_time attribute of the logon and
//     session restore/join results.
// 13) Client implementation must be ready to get new values of any field associated with enum specified in this protocol
//     (all these fields are made uint32 to make protocol backward compatible for such changes). So when client gets unknown value it should
//     either ignore it or check whether it relates to failure (e.g. whether it's > 100 for StatusCode/ResultCode fields).
// 14) Commodity volumes (or quantities) are specified in one of two forms: cqg.Decimal or uint64. A uint64 volume always means a number of
//     ContractMetadata.volume_scale units. Correct volume is calculated as 'volume' * 'ContractMetadata.volume_scale' in this case.
// 15) If a message - client or server - has two fields for the same volume (quantity): an old uint32 and a new cqg.Decimal,
//     the latter must be used. Old volume fields are left only for compatibility with clients using the protocol before
//     cqg.Decimals volumes introduction.
// 16) Avoid usage of commonly used keywords in message field names.

// Client to Server message, must include at least one field.
// Logon, LogonRoutineClient, RestoreOrJoinSession or ObtainDemoCredentials are required to be the first and the only message after connection.
// Client messages rate is limited, 1000 messages per 10 seconds by default.
// If this rate is exceeded then a user message is sent with details and the connection is closed.
// NOTE: This and other limits mentioned in this protocol are not guaranteed, they are given for reference only
// and are subject to change without prior notice.
